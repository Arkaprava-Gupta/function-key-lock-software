# Function key lock (Windows)

**Size: 1085 kb** 
(I was getting nearly 0% cpu usage when it was running...so it is very lightweight)

**How to use:**
Double click the icon (of exe file) to run it.  

**Features:**
By this .exe file one can press these keys (listed below) without Fn key to:
1) F1: mute 
2) F2: decrease volume
3) F3: increase volume
4) F7: decrease brightness
5) F8: increase brightness

**No reboots**

**No need to enter BIOS**

**No need to remember complex hotkeys for fn lock**

**No regedits**

**No complex setups procedures or complex UI**

**No need to turn antivirus off.**

**Purpose:**
It was created for my needs on a laptop on which I have to press the fn key and F1-F3 or F7-F8 keys for volume or brightness controls. 
I did not have the option to lock fn:
1)by fn+capslock or fn+ esc 
2)or by a software provided by the OEM 
3)or in BIOS

**Note:** 
1) Copy the .exe file and place it in (C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) 
2) Disable it from startup via Taskmanager.
3) To close it click the arrow key (right hand side of taskbar) and close it from there.
4) To remove it completely just delete the .exe file.
5) I had autohotkey preinstalled in my system.

**Credits:**
Autohotkey community for providing the code chunks ...which I later modified and made this.
Icon is from the myasus app ...since i made it for my usage only...will later modify it.
