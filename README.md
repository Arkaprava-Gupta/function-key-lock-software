# Fn lock based on autohotkey software (open source project) 

(Tested only on windows 10)


**Size: 1085 kb 
(I was getting nearly 0% cpu usage when it was running...so it is very lightweight)

**How to use:**
Double click the icon (of exe file) to run it.  
(No setups needed to install it...to uninstall just delete the exe file ...it will be removed without any trace...)

**Features:**
By this .exe file one can press these keys without Fn key to:
1) F1: mute 
2) F2: decrease volume
3) F3: increase volume
4) F7: decrease brightness
5) F8: increase brightness


**No need to reboot after running this app or even after closing it..no registry edits needed..just run and chill.
 Mcafee antivirus (on my system) was not blocking it so I didn't have to turn antivirus off.**
 
**Purpose:**
It was created for my needs on a laptop on which I have to press the fn key and F1-F3 or F7-F8 keys for volume or brightness controls. 
I did not have the option to lock fn 
1)by fn+capslock or fn+ esc 
2)or by a software provided by the OEM 
3)or in bios

**Note:** 
1) Copy the .exe file and place it in startup file (C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) so that you can use it without having to open manually.
2) Disable it from startup via Taskmanager.
3) To close it click the arrow key (right hand side of taskbar) and close it from there.
4) I had autohotkey preinstalled in my system.


**Credits:**
Autohotkey community for providing the code chunks ...which I later modified and made this.
Icon is from the myasus app ...since i made it for my usage only ...will later modify it.
