Fn lock software (Tested only on windows 10) based on autohotkey software (open source software) 

**Purpose:**
It was created for my needs on a laptop on which I have to press the fn key and F1-F3 or F7-F8 keys for volume or brightness controls. 
I did not have the option to lock fn 
1)by fn+capslock or fn+ esc 
2)or by a software provided by the OEM 
3)or in bios

**Features:**
By this .exe file one can press these keys without Fn key to:
*F1: mute 
F2: decrease volume
F3: increase volume
F7: decrease brightness
F8: increase brightness

**How to use:**
Double click the icon to run it. 

**Note:** 
1) Copy the .exe file and place it in startup file so that you can use it without having to open manually.
2) To close it click the arrow key (right hand side of taskbar) and close it from there.
3) I had autohotkey preinstalled in my system.

**Size: 1mb approx.** 
(I was getting nearly 0% cpu usage when it was running...so it is very lightweight)

**Credits:**
Autohotkey community for providing the code chunks ...which I later modified and made this.
Icon is from the myasus app ...since i made it for my usage only ...will later modify it
