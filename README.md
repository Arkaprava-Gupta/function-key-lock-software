**How to use:**
Double click the icon (of exe file) to run it.

Download the exe file for hassle free usage...for enthusiasts I will recommend modifying the .ahk script to fulfill custom needs

**Purpose:**
It was created for my needs on a laptop (Asus Tuf a15) on which I have to press the fn key and F1-F3 or F7-F8 keys for volume or brightness controls.
I did not have the option to lock fn:
1)by fn+capslock or fn+ esc 
2)or by a software provided by the OEM 
3)or in BIOS

**Features:**
By this .exe file one can press these keys (listed below) without Fn key to:
1) F1: mute 
2) F2: decrease volume
3) F3: increase volume
4) F7: decrease brightness
5) F8: increase brightness

**Additional Benefits:**

1) No reboots
2) No need to enter BIOS
3) No need to remember complex hotkeys for fn lock
4) No regedits
5) No complex setups procedures or complex UI
6) No need to turn antivirus off
7) No ads or trial end msgs
8) Size 1085 kb ...will not eat RAM like google chrome.
9) No need to provide personal data, No privacy breaches and no internet needed (will never ask for updates).
10) Not a Chinese app/software.
11) Will not ruin your keyboard like other apps.

**Note:** 
1) Copy the .exe file and place it in (C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) 
2) Disable it from startup via Taskmanager.
3) To close it click the arrow key (right hand side of taskbar) and close it from there.
4) To remove it completely just delete the .exe file.
5) I had autohotkey preinstalled in my system.

**Credits:**
Autohotkey community for providing the code chunks ...which I later modified and made this.
Icon is from the myasus app ...since i made it for my usage only...will later modify it.
