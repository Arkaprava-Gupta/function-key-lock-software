Function key lock (Windows)
How to use: Double click the icon (of exe file) to run it. Download the exe file for hassle free usage...for enthusiasts I will recommend modifying the .ahk script to fulfill custom needs

Purpose: It was created for my needs on a laptop (Asus Tuf a15) on which I have to press the fn key and F1-F3 or F7-F8 keys for volume or brightness controls. I did not have the option to lock fn: 1)by fn+capslock or fn+ esc 2)or by a software provided by the OEM 3)or in BIOS

Features: By this .exe file one can press these keys (listed below) without Fn key to:

F1: mute
F2: decrease volume
F3: increase volume
F7: decrease brightness
F8: increase brightness
Additional Benefits:

No reboots
No need to enter BIOS
No need to remember complex hotkeys for fn lock
No regedits
No complex setups procedures or complex UI
No need to turn antivirus off
No ads or trial end msgs
Size 1085 kb ...will not eat RAM like google chrome.
No need to provide personal data, No privacy breaches and no internet needed (will never ask for updates).
Not a Chinese app/software.
Will not ruin your keyboard like other apps.

Note:

Copy the .exe file and place it in (C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
Disable it from startup via Taskmanager.
To close it click the arrow key (right hand side of taskbar) and close it from there.
To remove it completely just delete the .exe file.
I had autohotkey preinstalled in my system.
